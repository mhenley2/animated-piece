  <h1> My sketch </h1>
  <p> This is my interactive audio-visual sketch for my creative coding module at UWE. When the canvas is pressed music is played. The background colour changes when buttons 1-4 are pressed on the keyboard. The 'leaves' also change transparency in states 1-4 when the spacebar is pressed. 
  I am still new to coding so this was a big challenge for me - but with help from lecturers and the internet my sketch is complete.</p>
